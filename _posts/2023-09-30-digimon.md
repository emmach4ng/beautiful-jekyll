Given a CSV file containing the stats of every Digimon from the series, three tasks were required:

1. Find the average speed of the Digimon
2. Write a function `count_digimon` that can count the number of Digimon with a specific attribute (e.g. `count_digimon("Type", "Vaccine")` would return 70).
3. Name a team of up to 3 Digimon with less than 15 memory and more than 300 attack in total

In working on this lab, I collaborated with Ellen Wang and Isabelle Fic.

## Finding the average speed

To calculate the average speed of the Digimon in the CSV file, the sum of each Digimon's speed must be divided by the total number of digimon.

To find this information, I began by defining a function `average_speed` that opens the file `digimon.csv` and reads it as a set of dictionaries.

~~~
def average_speed():
    with open("digimon/digimon.csv", "r") as f:
        data = csv.DictReader(f)
~~~

Then, with the CSV open, I defined the two totals that I needed to calculate the average speed: the sum of all speeds and the number of digimon in the dataset.

~~~
sum_of_speed = 0
digimon = 0
~~~

I constructed a for-loop that iterates through each `row` of the `data`, adding the digimon of that row's speed to the total speed and adding 1 to the total number of digimon.

~~~
for row in data:
  sum_of_speed += int(row["Spd"])
  digimon += 1
~~~

Finally, after iterating through the whole CSV, the final totals are used in the following calculation to find the `average_speed`: `average_speed = sum_of_speed / digimon`


Here's a table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |

How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://beautifuljekyll.com/assets/img/crepe.jpg)

It can also be centered!

![Crepe](https://beautifuljekyll.com/assets/img/crepe.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.

## Local URLs in project sites {#local-urls}

When hosting a *project site* on GitHub Pages (for example, `https://USERNAME.github.io/MyProject`), URLs that begin with `/` and refer to local files may not work correctly due to how the root URL (`/`) is interpreted by GitHub Pages. You can read more about it [in the FAQ](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq/#links-in-project-page). To demonstrate the issue, the following local image will be broken **if your site is a project site:**

![Crepe](/assets/img/crepe.jpg)

If the above image is broken, then you'll need to follow the instructions [in the FAQ](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq/#links-in-project-page). Here is proof that it can be fixed:
